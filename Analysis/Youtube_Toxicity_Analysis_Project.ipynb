    "    Problem Description: \n",
    "        Toxicity in the gaming community is a prevalent problem that hinders the harmonious development of the gaming industry. Our objective is to tackle this concern by exploring whether the game category (Action and Non-Action) serves as a primary determinant of toxicity levels in YouTube video comments. This study focuses on the observational perspective rather than the player angle. If proven, it can offer valuable insights for gaming community management, game design, and the design of social media platforms."
