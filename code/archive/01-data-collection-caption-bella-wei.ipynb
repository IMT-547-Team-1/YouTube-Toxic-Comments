    "\n",
    "_To support our examination of the impact of game genres on comment toxicity across YouTube gaming channels, we have devised the following data collection approach:_   \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Keyword Selection**: To **differentiate** action and non-action gaming videos on YouTube, we identified **two sets of keywords** representing popular games in each category.   \n",
    "\n",
    "    The keyword sets are as follows:    \n",
    "    **Action Games**: {\"call of duty\", \"gta\", \"the last of us\", \"god of war\", \"batman\", \"red dead redemption\", \"assassin's creed\", \"star wars jedi\", \"resident evil\", \"cyberpunk\", \"fallout\", \"tomb raider\", \"elden ring\"}    \n",
    "    **Non-Action Games**: {\"minecraft\", \"pokemon go\", \"just dance\", \"it takes two\", \"uncharted\", \"brawl stars\"}      \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Channel Selection**: From [SocialBook's Top 100 Gaming YouTubers](https://socialbook.io/youtube-channel-rank/top-100-gaming-youtubers), we curated a list of **33 channels** that predominantly create content in **English**.  For each channel, we **manually assigned** the binary labels `english` and `gamer` in `gamer-100.csv`, ensuring our focus on **English-speaking gaming community**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Collection**: Leveraging the **[YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)**, we gathered data from **30 videos per category for each channel**, using pre-defined keywords for action and non-action games.  We then collected the **100 most relevant top-level comments for each video**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    The sets of features include:  \n",
    "    **Comment Features**: `“video_id”, “comment_id”, “comment_author_id”, “comment_text”, “comment_time”, “comment_likecount”, \"comment_replycount\"`     \n",
    "    **Video Features**: `“channel_id”, “channel_name”, “video_id”, “video_title”, “video_creation_time”, “video_description”, “video_tags”, “video_viewcount”, “video_likecount”, \"video_commentcount\"`     \n",
    "\n",
    "_The final dataset consists of **140,637 comments** encompassing **17 video and comment features**.  Through analyzing this data, we aim to uncover insights into the dynamics of toxic commenting behaviors within the YouTube gaming communities.  `02-preprocessing.ipynb` will focus on **data cleaning, text preprocessing, and feature labeling** for subsequent analysis._    "

I don't know the thing\\nis on the left beside the bed some Blair\\nWitch burnt wood\\nis that this primary bedroom is\\nunbelievable we have this Japanese maple\\nwolf I was just gonna say it is a\\nJapanese style to do that it's like I\\nsee it a lot actually but they never\\ncode it my favorite this Atelier window\\nthat was custom designed just for this\\nPenthouse and the view you can see half\\nwow I always feel weird like people are\\nwatching me and they are I remember\\ngoing to a friend's house flying like\\nthis he had binoculars right there she's\\nlike yeah I love to spy on people I'm\\nlike it's a little\\nweird to be honest at the very top floor\\nthere's a bunch of Windows and I do have\\na pair of binoculars but I used it to\\nlook out at the ocean\\nand not it what do you look at the ocean\\nlike for Sirens what are you looking for\\nwell I can also see the park that my\\nkids play at from there too so I can use\\nthat he's quiet the kids yeah like okay\\nanybody\\ngoing towards a park right\\noh no\\nwhoa hold on a second no no that's kind\\nof cute actually like they're having so\\nmuch fun without me why aren't you just\\ngoing with them instead of spying on\\nyour kids I'm not spawn on them\\nI'm just like all right well let's see\\nare they are they I don't know just to\\nlook I have to leave the house I don't\\nleave the house we have very big windows\\nin our house and they didn't have any\\ntint on them when we first got the house\\nlike you could just literally you know\\nfrom that same park you could look into\\nmy house and just see like the whole\\nlike second floor so other people are\\nsprying on you is that what you're\\nsaying yeah so I installed like some I\\nhad I had a guy come and install like\\nsome uh reflective tent on the windows\\nin the house now they can't see inside\\nanymore but I can see them\\nbut that only works if it's brighter\\noutside than it is inside\\nMmm Yeah it's still dark enough to where\\nit kind of helps a little bit but yeah\\nthat's good a beautiful planted Terrace\\nwith maybe that's why people live in New\\nYork so they can just spy on other\\npeople they're all on the roofs looking\\neach other right now yeah but yeah the\\ntop is like Batman looking at you so let\\nme show you now the two dressing rooms\\ntoo that is ensuite to the bedroom\\nyou know I have

very\\nunique Central Park views the\\ncontinuation\\ncontinuation\\nwonderful wonderful view between these\\ntwo buildings here like look at that I\\ncan see it I can see it\\nwe had in our first flight where you\\ncould see the ocean like if you stood on\\nthis one specific spot\\nand they showed it no I don't know it's\\njust like obviously they make it a point\\nwhen you're you're viewing the property\\nbut it's like I don't think I ever even\\nlooked at it from that angle ever look\\nyou can see a bunch of dead trees if you\\nstand right here oh wow yes the\\ncontinuation of the beautiful\\nattribution just on the dining room we\\nalso have all custom designed Furniture\\njust put the space that is so that's why\\nthey're so ugly they can they're made\\nfor this space all right I got some\\nbroken glass here put some glue just\\npress it on yeah that's what it looks\\nlike oh look and make the space so\\nlavish now let's take a look at this we\\nhave the breakfast room right behind oh\\nthey can't like the couch cushion on the\\nbottom right it's like my butt is so\\nthin oh\\nmy whole body hurts just imagine living\\nhere oh\\nif I'm paying 39\\n39 at least a pool

water on the\\nrocks and it's the sauna right it yeah\\nthat's a sign okay we get but then the\\ntheme room is still the same\\nwhat's the difference I don't know when\\ndoes this have the old man naked old men\\nin it yeah I guess so yeah if there's\\nnot a naked man with hanging balls take\\na look at the kitchen the kitchen is\\nvery special here indeed it's down by\\nSaint Charles no one said that you can\\njust say that we said that it's kind of\\ncool actually I mean it looks like a\\nreally nice like servant kitchen yeah\\nit's kind of weird it looks like that\\nbecause it's kind of crazy which is one\\nof the best and they only do custom work\\nso yes as you can see you have this\\nbeautiful metal cabinets the incredibly\\nnice layout you have this is a toolbox\\nit's already scratched and stained it\\nlooks like a toolbox like yeah you're\\nright it does it's like 39 million I\\ndon't want stains on my thing already\\nwhat are all these faucets for what is\\nall this it's
