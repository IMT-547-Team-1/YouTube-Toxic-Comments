    "**Problem Description**:  \n",
    "Toxicity in the gaming community is a prevalent problem that hinders the harmonious development of the gaming industry. Our objective is to tackle this concern by exploring whether the game category (Action and Non-Action) serves as a primary determinant of toxicity levels in YouTube video comments. This study focuses on the observational perspective rather than the player angle. If proven, it can offer valuable insights for gaming community management, game design, and the design of social media platforms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial RQ**:\n",
    "- Do videos of action games arouse significant more toxic comments than non-action games in YouTube?  \n",
    "- Is gaming category a primary predictor for toxic comments in YouTube?  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Findings in Phase 1**:\n",
    "- Videos of action games arouse a little more toxic comments than non-action games, but the influence is not very strong. \n",
    "- Gaming category is not a primary predictor for toxic comments in YouTube.\n"

    "- Topics in toxic videos are expected to involve more violence, war, and fights compared to harmonious videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation**:  \n",
    "In this phase, we focus on investigating the relationship between video content and the comment section. If we can identify patterns or causal relationships in the video content and user interactions within the comment section, we can offer insightful suggestions to social media platforms on how to prevent toxic comments. This could involve censoring potentially harmful video content before it leads to toxic interactions and has a widespread negative impact."

This difference may be attributed to the fact that oral language is more prone to being toxic than written comments. Additionally, some language used during gameplay may not necessarily imply bad intentions and could be less serious in nature."

    "From our further exploration, we can answer our update research questions:\n",
    "- Videos with higher toxicity in the transcript generally tend to trigger more toxic comments, but the relationship is not strong or causal. It is not an accurate predictor of comment toxicity. The distribution of comment toxicity appears somewhat random and may be influenced by various factors other than just the toxicity of the transcript.\n",
    "- Youtubers who use more toxic language are likely to trigger more toxic comments, but is not the only determinator.\n",
    "- Surprisingly, the common topics in the most toxic and least toxic videos exhibit clear differences and patterns. Toxic videos frequently cover negative topics such as 'violence,' 'war,' and 'kill,' while non-toxic videos predominantly feature positive topics like 'music,' 'dance,' 'art,' and 'fun.' Intuitively, it can be observed that the topics in toxic videos are more negative in nature compared to non-toxic videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Updated Question**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are other primary factors or predictors of online gaming toxicity?\n",
    "- How can our insights inform practical strategies for fostering a healthier online interaction environment?\n",
    "            \n",
    "**Relate to Domain Knowledge**:   \n",
    "\n",
    "- From our toxicity calculation using the Perspective API, we discovered that the toxicity in the video transcript is much higher than in the comments. This difference may be attributed to the common and non-harmful use of certain language within the gaming community while playing games. Such language does not necessarily imply malicious intent, prompting us to explore methods for detecting the genuine intentions behind oral language use beyond the literal words in gaming area."
